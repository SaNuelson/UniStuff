This repo started as a way for me to keep track of all the notes, assignments and whatnot. If it helps out anyone else, that's just a plus.

I by no means claim it to be without mistakes and if you find any and want to fix it, let me know on Disc or make a PR.

How to use
===

Most of the notes are put down in markdown format in most cases enriched by Latex math, in some by CSS sprinkles.

I personally view and edit it via **VSCode** with [**Markdown All in One extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) installed. AFAIK, it takes care of both latex and CSS. Also has built-in preview.
